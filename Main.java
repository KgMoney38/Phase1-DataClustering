//Java Practices and Style Guide from my Google search: This one seems to cover a little more https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html
//However, I like the layout of the sections better on this one, so I will reference both (they should contain basically the same information as these practice are kind of industry standard I think)
//but I will primarily use https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/JavaAndDS/JavaStyle.html
